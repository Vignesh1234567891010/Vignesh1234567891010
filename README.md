I have built many industry grade projects from scratch and am armed with many technological skills useful for tech projects. Check out my projects below.

1. A Quiz application
   Sep 2024

   XQuiz is a quiz application that allows us to create a Quiz comprising multiple Questions. Each Question will have multiple choices, of which one will be a correct answer. This application can display the
